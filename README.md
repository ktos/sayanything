SayAnything
================

SayAnything is a very simple app for Windows Phone 8 using introduced
at that time Speech APIs allowing user to put any text and pressing
"speak" button to hear as automated Text-To-Speech system will say
the phrase. It allowed to select different voices available on the
device.

It is [published](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/powiedzcos/9nblggh0flts) 
in the Windows Store and was even downloaded a few times, but is not
supported nor under active development for a few years. So I decided
to open-source it, maybe will be useful to someone.

App is targeted for Windows Phone 8.0 using Silverlight and has a few
tricks, for example to get correct locale-based app name on the tile.
